# Front-End-Nanodegree-Build-a-Portfolio-Site
Series of responsive portfolio sites designed from a given mockup from Udacity. This is the first project in the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Program
## Purpose
I was provided a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. I developed a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects I completed through the course of the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree.
